# Templates

A template allows you to create variations of prompts from data.

When creating a prompt you can make use of templates to quickly insert data in your prompt, or create large numbers of prompts from a [set](./sets).

## Syntax

PromptStudio uses [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) as a template language. Below are a few examples of its usage:

### Template with Free-text variable

If you write the following in your template draft:

```md title="template"
Hello {{my_var}}!
```

Then on the left side, as shown with the arrow below, a variable dropdown will be created where you can set your value. In this example, we will set the variable type of be 'Free text'

![variable_section](../images/screenshots/variable_section.png)

When you fill in your value and click on **_Enter_**, a prompt will be generated here:

![prompt_generated](../images/screenshots/prompt_generated.png)

You can then click on the generated prompt on the right tab to see the full prompt preview in the center tab as shown here:

![prompt_preview](../images/screenshots/prompt_preview.png)

### Template with a Set as variable

Let's say that you create a set like this one:

<img src={story_characteristics} alt="story_characteristics" width="50%" />

You can write a template like this for example

```
Write a story with the following characteristics:

{{story_characteristics}}
```

After setting the `story_characteristics` to the set that we created above, a prompt will be generated looking as follows:

![prompt_set_preview](../images/screenshots/story_prompt_preview.png)

After clicking on **_Run Prompt_**, the result is this:

![scary_story_result](../images/completions/scary_story_result.png)

### Generating several prompts from a set

Sometimes you want to compare completions over large numbers of prompts. With Prompt Studio you can do that by assigning a set to a variable and selecting "Create completion for each item".

Given the template:

```
A cat named Mumin goes out for a walk. He suddenly stops when he sees a tiny puffy creature. Generate a {{mood}} continuation to the story.
```

Let's say that you have the following set of story moods that you are passing as the `mood` variable:

<img src={story_moods} alt="story_moods" width="50%" />

You can generate several prompts and compare their results by selecting this checkbox in the **_Template variables_** area

<img src={several_prompts} alt="several_prompts" width="40%" />

If you click on **_Run Prompt_**, you will get the following two prompts with their respective completion:

<img src={sad_image} alt="sad_result" width="50%" />
<img src={happy_image} alt="happy_result" width="50%" />

### Loops

You can also loop over your data within a single prompt, given the template below:

```
Hello

{{#names}}
- {{.}}
{{/names}}
```

And the variables:

<img src={loops_var} alt="loops_var" width="50%" />

The following prompt will be generated:

```md title="prompt"
Hello

- Moomin
- Snufkin
- Groke
```

### Comments

You can also write comments in your prompt templates.

```
{{! this is a multiline comment and will not
be part of any prompt created from this template
}}
```

## Usecases

This can be useful in different scenarios.

### Few Shot Prompting

In few-shot prompting you provide a set of examples as part of your prompt. In some scenarios this can produce more
accurate results.

```md
Is the following sentence positive or negative?

Examples:

This is awesome! // Positive
This is bad! // Negative
Wow that movie was rad! // Positive

Sentence:

What a horrible show! //
```

Given the additional information from the example above, the model would complete the prompt with

```md
Negative
```

With a template we can extract this type of data out of the prompt:

```mustache
Is the following sentence positive or negative?

Examples:

{{#examples}}
{{.}}
{{/examples}}

Sentence:

{{userQuery}} //
```

Now you can provide different sets of examples and test the prompt on different types of queries and easily compare the
results between runs.
