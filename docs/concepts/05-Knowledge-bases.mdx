# Knowledge bases
You can generate a Knowledge base by uploading files into Prompt Studio, you can drag and drop the following files formats:
.md, .txt, .pdf and .json

You can think of a Knowledge base as a way for you to gather all the knowledge from your files to be able to start a chat based on 
that knowledge base. A knowledge base wouldn't necessarily contain only files that fall under the same topic, it can also be 
generated from files that talk about different topics if you are looking to understand a broad spectrum of topics.

## Example of usage
Let's say you are a novel writer, and you want to write a story that is set in pre-Columbian times. You don't have the time to read 
through long articles about pre-Columbian times specifics but you still want your novel to have realistic components from that time 
in history. In our case, we found an article called "Vernacular architecture in the pre-Columbian Americas" that's 21 pages long. 
First, we click on the **+ New Asset** sign to create the knowledge base, then we upload it by drag and dropping our file as follows: 

<img
  src={dragndrop_kb}
  alt="dragndrop_kb"
  width="70%"
  style={{ height: "auto" }}
/>

Then we will generate a knowledge base from that. Let's explore in the [Chat](chats) section how we can start writing our novel based on that.
