# Knowledge bases
You can generate a Knowledge Base by uploading files into Prompt Studio, you can drag and drop the following file formats:
.md, .txt, .pdf and .json

You can think of a Knowledge Base as an index for a set of files that you can then use as a context inside of a chat. A knowledge 
base is not limited to containing only files related to a single topic; it can also be constructed using files that cover various 
subjects, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of a wide range of topics.

## Example of usage
Imagine you are a novelist, intending to craft a story set in pre-Columbian times. However, due to time constraints, delving into 
lengthy articles on specific aspects of that historical period may not be feasible. Nonetheless, you aspire to infuse your novel with 
realistic elements from that era.
First, we click on the **+ New Asset** sign to create a Knowledge Base from an article that speaks about pre-columbian architecture, 
then we upload it by drag and dropping our file as follows: 

<img
  src={dragndrop_kb}
  alt="dragndrop_kb"
  width="70%"
  style={{ height: "auto" }}
/>

Then we will generate a knowledge base from the file. 

The Knowledge Base can act as context for the chat, so let's explore in the [Chat](chats) section how we can start writing our novel 
based on this knowledge base.
