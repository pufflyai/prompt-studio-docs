# Knowledge bases
You can generate a Knowledge Base by uploading files into Prompt Studio, you can drag and drop the following file formats:
.md, .txt, .pdf and .json

You can think of a Knowledge Base as an index for a set of files that you can then use as a context inside of a chat. A knowledge 
base is not limited to containing only files related to a single topic; it can also be constructed using files that cover various 
subjects, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of a wide range of topics.

## Example of usage
Let's say you are a novel writer, and you want to write a story that is set in pre-Columbian times. You don't have the time to read 
through long articles about pre-Columbian times specifics but you still want your novel to have realistic components from that time 
in history. In our case, we found an article called "Vernacular architecture in the pre-Columbian Americas" that's 21 pages long. 
First, we click on the **+ New Asset** sign to create the knowledge base, then we upload it by drag and dropping our file as follows: 

<img
  src={dragndrop_kb}
  alt="dragndrop_kb"
  width="70%"
  style={{ height: "auto" }}
/>

Then we will generate a knowledge base from that. In order to interact with your knowledge base, you need to start a chat, and pass your
knowledge base to it. Let's explore in the [Chat](chats) section how we can start writing our novel based on this knowledge base.
