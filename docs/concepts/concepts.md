# Concepts

We currently support **three** types of assets:

- [Prompt](/concepts/Prompts)
- [Set](/concepts/sets)
- [File](/concepts/Files)

To create an asset, click on the **+** button, you will see the assets, as seen below.

<img src={create_asset} alt="create_asset" width="30%" />

#### Collection

A collection groups multiple assets: a prompt, set, file or another collection. You can use it organize your assets. We are working on adding a feature to be able to share collections with others.
