# Chat
If you want to interact with a large language model through a Chat, you can start a Chat by clicking on the **+ New Asset** button 
and selecting **+ New Chat**.

The language model can leverage the information from a [Knowledge Base](Knowledge-bases) to generate more accurate and meaningful responses. 
The contextual understanding provided by the knowledge base enhances the overall quality of the conversation and allows for a more informed 
and relevant exchange of information. To create your context from a Knowledge Base, you can click on the **_ + _** sign as shown in the image below:

<img
  src={chat_without_kb}
  alt="chat_without_kb"
  width="90%"
  style={{ height: "auto" }}
/>


In the image below, you can see an example where we passed the Knowledge Base that we generated in the [previous section](Knowledge-bases).
