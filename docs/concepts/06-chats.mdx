# Chat
If you prefer to interact with a large language model through a Chat, you can start a Chat by clicking on the **+ New Asset** button 
and selecting **+ New Chat**.

To show how a knowledge base can improve the results of your chat, we will show the example below where we are asking the following 
question in the chat: 

`Using the context above, describe the Scene of a story where our protagonist encounters a typical building from pre-columbian 
south america in an archeological dig site. Describe the dig site keep in mind the effect preservation of building roofs of vernacular 
architecture`

## Chat without knowledge base

The answer provided by the LLM is not too bad, it does give some good descriptions associated with pre-Columbian times, but let's compare
this answer to the one provided when we associate the chat with the knowledge base that we generated [previously](knowledge-bases) using 
the article about "Vernacular architecture in the pre-Columbian Americas". 

## Chat with knowledge base

<img
  src={chat_with_kb}
  alt="chat_with_kb"
  width="90%"
  style={{ height: "auto" }}
/>

You can notice that the descriptions in the scene here are a lot more detailed. The answer mentions "The building was made of adobe 
bricks and had a thatched roof, which was surprisingly well-preserved despite the passage of time. The walls were decorated with intricate
designs, and the door was adorned with a wooden lintel. **The protagonist couldn't believe their luck**."
The reason the answer mentions that the protagonist couldn't believe their luck is because according to the article that we passed
to the knowledge base, most of roofs and walls from pre-Columbian times have disappeared, so archeologists only rely on stone 
and earthen foundations of buildings. This is something that we can see wasn't mentioned in the previous chat answers where we didn't 
provide the knowledge base. It actually mentions that the protagonist found a structure with detailed carvings. 
This is just one example that shows the benefits of generating a knowledge base and passing it to your chat to make it more accurate.
