# Overview

**Prompt Studio** is a tool designed to help you explore, test and manage your prompts with different AI systems. With
Prompt Studio you can compare results from different models, quickly explore prompt variations and test different use
cases. Additionally, Prompt Studio will provide collaborative features, allowing you to share workspaces with others and
collaborate in real-time.

Prompt Studio aims to become the go-to tool for engineering prompts for language models.

Think of it like **Postman but for LLMs**.
